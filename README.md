# Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my readme! I decided I not only wanted to get better using Github, but I wanted to learn JavaScript and then transition to Node and Angular, but at the moment I have a lot of things that I want to learn. I admit it...I am somewhat of a noob lol, but I made a concious decision to improve myself every day!

## The Material
```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
